# Frontend Project Documentation

## Overview
This is the frontend of the project, built using React and TypeScript. It serves as the user interface for the application.

## Directory Structure
- **src/components**: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **src/pages**: Contains different pages of the application, each representing a route.
- **src/App.tsx**: The main component that sets up routing and renders the main layout.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Components in the `src/components` directory can be imported and used in any page or component.
- Each page in the `src/pages` directory corresponds to a route in the application.
- Modify `src/App.tsx` to change the main layout or routing logic.
